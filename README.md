# Cplusplus-Program-CS210

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I choose project three the Wildlife Zoo. The project was testing that their system integration and design concepts are feasible and that they will deliver the overarching functionality they require. I created the project in IDE. We used the TheZoo.cpp file to link to the Java class using JNI which was the ZooFileWriter.java file.

2. What did you do particularly well?
I felt that I particularly did well in is uploading the files into Eclipse and then complete the code and following the wildlife Zoo interface Guide that we used in assignment 6-3 when setting Up the JNI from HelloWorld. Also, by includes all of the functional requirements I could debug the code easier. Module Six assignment, you must build the pathways for your project. 

3. Where could you enhance your code? 
I enhance the code by going into more detail about each line of code in TheZoo.cpp file.

4. How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The improvements that makes my code more efficient and secure is by having more detail within each line of code, well help me in future assignments understand the different steps I took when dealing with linking a C++ to a Java class file using JNI.

5. Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? 
Yes, I did find some parts challenging and I overcame and how I will overcome this in the future   is by make my code simple to run and include a Readme. Read the instructions carefully. Always try and make it readable. Focus on the test input. Always remember to get help if you need it. Carefully review and keep the code organized. It is good to get useful criticism on your code.

6. What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The tools and resources are I adding to support my network are the supporting materials that helped me alone the way in order to complete the code from textbooks to websites.

7. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and course work by understand how to link a C++ to a Java class file using JNI.

8. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Making the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by always having clean code and keeping my code organized and having simple notes for each line of code that I include.
